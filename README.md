### Cooking site that uses a Hybrid Recommender System with Trend Analysis
University final year project for my degree in Computer Science and Mathematics.

#### Hybrid Recommender System
The hybrid recommender consists of a Collaborative Filtering model and a Content-based Filtering model that are combined to produce highly relevant recipes to a user - based on what they have enjoyed in the past, and what similar users have also enjoyed.

#### Trend Analysis Algorithm
This works by finding out what is the most trending recipe ingredient from the last 3 days, and then produces a list of recipes that contain that ingredient - to show trending and in season recipes to viewers.
